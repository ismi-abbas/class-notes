# JavaScript

Javascript is not JAVA with script, it is entirely new language. You can find the history of the language in the internet. Long story short, it is used by the modern browser now to handle the DOM scripting. As of 2009, JavaScript runtime called **NodeJS** was invented and enable it to run in local environment instead of a browser only. We will learn later on this course about NodeJS.

### Running Javascript

Unlike any other languages, Javascript doesn't need a specific compiler to run, because the compiler was built in browser called V8 engines. So you just need to open the console and type something like `console.log('Hellooo')`. This is a valid javascript. Or you can write script in a `<script></script>` tag in the head of your HTML.
