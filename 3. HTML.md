# HTML - Hypertext Markup Language

HTML is markup language(not really a programming language) used to structure our website. We can simple make a file name `index.html`, write a text `Hello World!!!` and open it on a browser, it will display a **Hello World** text. But this is the simple form, what we wan to achieve is something that have a structure, and we can sort of arrange it where it should be.

It begins with the base structure.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
		<title>Hello World HTML</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		Hello World
	</body>
</html>
```

This is the simplest structure of the a web page. The **title** tag in the **head** tag is to display at the tab name when you open it on a browser. It is also being use by google to name your website on the google search result page.

Inside **head** we can write the metatags for the web, import **styling** and import **script**. 
- For outside styling we can import by using `Link` tag. Example `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />`. The file **style.css** must be located the same directory as the current **index.html**, or you will need to add relative path to it.
- Import script using `<script></script>` tag. Example we want to use **JQuery** cdn. So we can add in the `<head/>` tag as `<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-/JqT3SQfawRcv/BIHPThkBvs0OEvtFFmqPF/lYI/Cxo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`

Following the head we have the `<body></body>` tag. This is where our content is located.
Other common tags/elements used are
- div
- section
- nav
- footer
- input
- form
- button
