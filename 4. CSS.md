Thank you for providing this introduction to CSS. I'll restructure and expand on the content to make it more comprehensive and easier to understand:

# CSS - Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is a styling language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It consists of two main components: selectors and declarations.

## 1. Selectors

Selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements. There are several types of selectors:

### 1.1 Element Selectors

Select all instances of a specific HTML element:

```css
h1 {
	/* styles for all <h1> elements */
}
div {
	/* styles for all <div> elements */
}
p {
	/* styles for all <p> elements */
}
```

### 1.2 Class Selectors

Select elements with a specific class attribute:

```css
.btn {
	/* styles for elements with class="btn" */
}
.wrapper {
	/* styles for elements with class="wrapper" */
}
```

Class names are user-defined and can be applied to multiple elements.

### 1.3 ID Selectors

Select a single element with a specific id attribute:

```css
#main-page {
	/* styles for the element with id="main-page" */
}
#main-content {
	/* styles for the element with id="main-content" */
}
```

IDs should be unique within a page.

### 1.4 Attribute Selectors

Select elements based on their attributes or attribute values:

```css
[type="text"] {
	/* styles for elements with type="text" */
}
[data-state="active"] {
	/* styles for elements with data-state="active" */
}
```

### 1.5 Pseudo-class Selectors

Select elements based on a certain state:

```css
a:hover {
	/* styles for links when hovered */
}
input:focus {
	/* styles for input elements when focused */
}
```

### 1.6 Combinators

Combine multiple selectors:

```css
div > p {
	/* styles for <p> elements that are direct children of <div> elements */
}
h1 + p {
	/* styles for <p> elements that directly follow an <h1> element */
}
```

## 2. Declarations

Declarations consist of properties and their values, which define how the selected elements should be styled.

```css
selector {
	property1: value1;
	property2: value2;
	/* more property-value pairs */
}
```

Example:

```css
h1 {
	font-family: Inter, sans-serif;
	font-size: 20px;
	font-weight: 600;
	color: #333;
	margin-bottom: 1em;
}
```

Common properties include:

- `color`: text color
- `background-color`: background color
- `font-size`: size of the font
- `margin`: space outside an element
- `padding`: space inside an element
- `border`: border around an element
- `display`: how an element should be displayed (block, inline, flex, etc.)

## 3. CSS Rules

A complete CSS rule combines selectors and declarations:

```css
selector1,
selector2 {
	property1: value1;
	property2: value2;
}
```

## 4. Cascading and Specificity

CSS rules can overlap, and the cascade determines which styles are applied based on:

1. Importance (`!important` flag)
2. Specificity (ID > Class > Element)
3. Source order (later rules override earlier ones)

## 5. Responsive Design

Use media queries to apply different styles based on device characteristics:

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
	/* Styles for screens up to 600px wide */
}
```
